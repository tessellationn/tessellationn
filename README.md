Hello!

I'm an artist trying to learn to code... I'd really like to learn HTML or CSS. It would be fun to be able to build a website from scratch. 

I really like having collections of things, so maybe I'll use github to upload files I want to hang onto. It seems like a better way to keep stuff organized than my bookmarks menu.

I wish I could make my profile look like a geocities website, that'd be fun.
